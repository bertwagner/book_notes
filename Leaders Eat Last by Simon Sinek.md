# Leaders Eat Last by Simon Sinek

- >Marine leaders are expected to eat last because the true price of leadership is the willingness to place the needs of others above your own . Great leaders truly care about those they are privileged to lead and understand that the true cost of the leadership privilege comes at the expense of self - interest . (xii)

- >"If your actions inspire others to dream more , learn more , do more and become more , you are a leader ." -John Quincy Adams (xii)

- >When leaders inspire those they lead , people dream of a better future , invest time and effort in learning more , do more for their organizations and along the way become leaders themselves . (xii)

- >These exceptional organizations all have cultures in which the leaders provide cover from above and the people on the ground look out for each other . (9)
    - Empathy builds strong teams. Why do something for someone else? Because you know they would do the same for you.

- >“ When you have people who trust you , they’re going to do a better job for you to earn or keep that trust . ” (13)
    - Factory workers in failing business had restrictions removed (time cards, free company phones, etc… and ended up performing better).

- > Working with a sense of obligation is replaced by working with a sense of pride . (14)
    - Caring about your employees makes them work with pride, making them more likely to fix problems on their own and make the company better.

- >This feeling of belonging , of shared values and a deep sense of empathy , dramatically enhances trust , cooperation and problem solving . (24)

- >United States Marines are better equipped to confront external dangers because they fear no danger from each other . They operate in a strong Circle of Safety . (24)
    - Circle of Safety is where people can trust each other.
    - Worried about competing with peers would reduce that circle

- > Intimidation , humiliation , isolation , feeling dumb , feeling useless and rejection are all stresses we try to avoid inside the organization . But the danger inside is controllable and it should be the goal of leadership to set a culture free of danger from each other . (26)

- > It’s a leaders job to have employees not worry about these things, so they can focus on doing good work instead. (26)
    - It’s a leaders job to have employees not worry about these things, so they can focus on doing good work instead.

- > When we believe that those inside our group , those inside the Circle , will look out for us , it creates an environment for the free exchange of information and effective communication . (29)

- > We are social animals , and being social was as important to us thousands of years ago as it is today . It was a significant way we built and maintained trust and the way we got to know each other . The time we spend getting to know people when we’re not working is part of what it takes to form bonds of trust . It’s the exact same reason why eating together and doing things as a family really matters . Equally as important are conferences , company picnics and the time we spend around the watercooler . (43) 

- > Oxytocin and serotonin grease the social machine . And when they are missing , friction results . When the leaders of an organization create a culture that inhibits the release of these chemicals , it is tantamount to sabotage — sabotage of our careers and our happiness and sabotage of the success of the organization itself . (56) 
    - If your people can’t work in a fun and safe environment, they will work with each other less effectively and cause worse outcomes.

- >We all want to feel valuable for the effort we put forth for the good of others in the group or the group itself . If we could get that feeling alone , then we wouldn’t have awards ceremonies , company recognition programs or graduation ceremonies . (57)

-> Those who work hardest to help others succeed will be seen by the group as the leader or the “ alpha ” of the group . And being the alpha — the strong , supportive one of the group , the one willing to sacrifice time and energy so that others may gain — is a prerequisite for leadership . (59)

- > One person hears a rumor that there are going to be layoffs . He tells a friend at work . And before too long , just like the herd of gazelles , one by one , the word spreads and the whole office starts chatting and worrying , anxious about the impending layoffs . All the employees have a heightened sense of alertness thanks to the cortisol flowing through their veins . (67)
    - Need to make sure people fee safe so they aren’t distracted by stuff like layoffs and other dangers.

- >The leaders of organizations who rise through the ranks not because they want it , but because the tribe keeps offering higher status out of gratitude for their willingness to sacrifice , are the true leaders worthy of our trust and loyalty . (83)

- >“ It is better that we all suffer a little , ” he told his people , “ so that none of us has to suffer a lot . ” (86)
    - In regards to everyone needing to take 4 weeks unpaid leave so didn’t have to have layoffs.

- >We cannot motivate others , per se . Our motivation is determined by the chemical incentives inside every one of us . Any motivation we have is a function of our desire to repeat behaviors that make us feel good or avoid stress or pain . The only thing we can do is create environments in which the right chemicals are released for the right reasons . And if we get the environment right , if we create organizational cultures that work to the natural inclinations of the human animal , the result will be an entire group of self - motivated people . (88)

- > The bigger our companies get , the more physical distance is created between us and the people who work for us or buy our products . (126)
-> The more abstract people become , the more capable we are of doing them harm . (127)
    - Employees get abstracted away, just like the electroshock experiment where shocking someone far away made people follow the directives more regardless of their moral beliefs.

- > A leader who presides over a weak culture does not invest in programs to build the confidence of their people so that they will do the right thing . Instead , command and control perpetuates a system in which people will more likely do the thing that’s right for them . (129)
-> Anything that separates us from the impact our words and actions have on other people has the potential to lead us down a dangerous path  (129)
    - Whole peanut company new peanuts had salmonella, but workers shipped as they were told because they could abstract the blame to the owner/president.

- >This is one of the shortcomings of using numbers to represent people . At some point , the numbers lose their connection to the people and become just numbers , void of meaning . (138)
    - Example used is a news story that was personal about one person dying vs a story about Syria killings 100k+.

- >If there is a clear vision of a future state brighter than our world today , we can work to build it . And if it is to advance a metric from one number to another , we can do that too . But when numbers are the only thing we can see , our ability to perceive the distant impact our decisions may have is frustrated . (138)

-> the most valuable thing we can do if we are to truly serve our constituents is to know them personally . It would be impossible to know all of them , but to know the name and details of the life of someone we are trying to help with our product , service or policy makes a huge difference . (138)

-> Because nothing can replace face - to - face meetings for social animals like us . A live concert is better than the DVD and going to a ball game feels different from watching on TV , even though the view is better on television . We like to actually be around people who are like us . It makes us feel like we belong . (140)

- > Trust is not formed through a screen , it is formed across a table . (140)

- > Real , live human interaction is how we feel a part of something , develop trust and have the capacity to feel for others . It is how we innovate . It is why telecommuters never really feel like they are a part of the team as strongly as the ones who go to work every day . (141)

- >Which is why Dunbar’s Number is about 150 (143)
    - Size of a group shouldn’t be larger than this - you can’t know more than 150 people well

- >when groups get bigger than about 150 , the people are less likely to work hard and less likely to help each other out . (143)

- > This means , for larger organizations , the only way to manage the scale and keep the Circle of Safety strong is to rely on hierarchies . A CEO can “ care ” about their people in the abstract , but not until that abstraction is mitigated can the care be real . The only way to truly manage at scale is to empower the levels of management . They can no longer be seen as managers who handle or control people . Instead , managers must become leaders in their own right , which means they must take responsibility for the care and protection of those in their charge , confident that their leaders will take care of them . (145)

- > “ Destructive Abundance ” is what I call the result of this imbalance . It is what happens when selfish pursuits are out of balance with selfless pursuits . (155)

- > Inside a Circle of Safety , when people trust and share their successes and failures , what they know and what they don’t know , the result is innovation . (170)

- >We work to advance the vision of a leader who inspires us and we work to undermine a dictator who means to control us . (173)

- >“ Those at the top , ” explains Captain Marquet , “ have all the authority and none of the information . Those at the bottom , ” he continues , “ have all the information and none of the authority . Not until those without information relinquish their control can an organization run better , smoother and faster and reach its maximum potential . ” (180)

- > the role of the leader is not to bark commands and be completely accountable for the success or failure of the mission . It is a leader’s job instead to take responsibility for the success of each member of his crew . (181)

- >“ I can’t delegate my legal responsibilities , I can’t delegate my relationships and I can’t delegate my knowledge . Everything else , however , I can ask others to take responsibility for , ” (182)

- >When our leaders reveal their gaps in knowledge and missteps , not only are we more willing to help , but we too are more willing to share when we make mistakes or when things go wrong . (182)

- > “ The goal of a leader is to give no orders , ” Captain Marquet explains . “ Leaders are to provide direction and intent and allow others to figure out what to do and how to get there . ” (183)

- >If members of Congress don’t spend any time together , if they don’t get to know each other and the people they represent , the flow of the social chemicals is limited and the drive to raise money and win elections makes dopamine their primary incentive . The environment in which our legislators now work makes it difficult for them to trust each other or work together for the benefit of anyone but themselves . (203)

- >There is something about getting together out of context that makes us more open to getting to know someone . Whether we’re bonding with colleagues with whom we play on the company softball team , out to lunch or on a business trip with someone we don’t know well , when the responsibilities of our jobs are not forcing us to work together , when our competing interests are put aside for a while , we seem to be quite open to seeing others as people rather than coworkers or competitors . (204)

- >Customers will never love a company until the employees love it first . (223)

- Don’t become addicted to hitting metrics at the cost of sacrificing value to your customers (the example in this chapter was the news used to be good and trusted, today much less so because of producers chasing audience numbers and promoting clickbait headlines).

- >Leaders of successful organizations , if they wish to innovate or command loyalty and love from their people , must reframe the struggles their companies face not in absolute terms but in terms relative to their success . In other words , the dangers and opportunities that exist outside the Circle of Safety should be exaggerated to suit the size of the organization itself . (282)

- >Small companies innovate because they are constantly reminded of the hardship and struggles (hardship and struggles are the cause for our most memorable work moments -as long as they end in success). Big companies are comfortable and need to emphasize the struggle in different terms in order to produce innovation. (282)

- >To really inspire us , we need a challenge that outsizes the resources available . We need a vision of the world that does not yet exist . A reason to come to work . Not just a big goal to achieve . This is what leaders of great organizations do . They frame the challenge in terms so daunting that literally no one yet knows what to do or how to solve it . (283)

- >Everything about being a leader is like being a parent . It is about committing to the well - being of those in our care and having a willingness to make sacrifices to see their interests advanced so that they may carry our banner long after we are gone . (287)
