# Introductory Topics for Everyone

## Chapter 1 - Introduction and Motivation

 - 4 themes of controlled experiments:
   1. "It is hard to assess the value of an idea." - seemingly unimportant ideas can have huge returns.
   2. Small changes can have big impact.
   3. Big impact experiments are rare. Bing runs 10k+ experiments per year, big improvement features happen once every few years.
   4. Overhead of running experiments must be small.
 - It's useful to have "too good to be true" business rule alerts programmed around your experiment to check for bugs after deployment.
 - Overall Evaluation Criterion (OEC) must be measurable in the short term but be aligned with long-term strategic objectives.
 - 4 things are needed for useful experiments:
   1. You are able to split users into treatment and control groups.
   2. You have enough users to get meaningful results. Small changes to outcomes need more users.
   3. Key metrics (OEC) must be agreed upon and practically evaluated.
   4. Changes are easy to make.
 - Sometimes it is impossible to run controlled experiments - chapter 10 covers complementary techniques.
 - Success rates:
   - Microsoft: 33% of ideas tested led to improvements
   - Bing/Google: 12% success
   - Slack: 30% success
   - Netflix: 10% success
 - Improvmenets are usually measured in .1%-2%. Bing's yearly goal is 2% improvement.
 - Speed matters a lot:
   - Bing: 10 millisecond performance improvmenet pays for engineer
   - Amazon: 100 millisecond performance slow-down decreases sales 1%.
